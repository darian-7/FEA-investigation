# FEA-investigation
Applied Solid Mechanics coursework for third year Mechanical Engineering at the University of Bristol
Conducted an FEA investigation on the structural integrity of the lifting lugs of a large vessel's Gas Combustion Unit. This was the summative coursework as part of my third year unit: Applied Solid Mechanics. I analyzed the lugs vertical deflection and stress by simulating the environment on Abaqus CAE. I completed a mesh convergence study based on the results I gathered by the software and validated it with numerical solutions. I then carried out an in-depth analysis into the failure characteristics of one of the GCU's load-bearing structural components. I did numerical modeling of its probability of failure, stress and strain, and explored different failure mechanisms on the component via MATLAB software.
